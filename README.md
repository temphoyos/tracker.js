# tracker.js
Super simple tracking script to track certain user interactions on my personal site. I add a clic eventListener to the body object and a callback event handling function. When selected events take place, a defined dataLayer.push() call is executed to populated the Google Tag Manager (GTM) dataLayer with certain params.
